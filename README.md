# gf-efs-phoenix-otr-wexauth-rsdemo
This project is a demo for authorizing and authenticating the request to API Endpoint by the client or client API. This project uses the [WEX auth library](https://github.com/wexinc/gf-efs-phoenix-otr-wexauth) for authenticating the token, which is being passed in the request.


## WEX Dvelopment Portal

[Wex Development portal](https://portal.wexapps.com/) provides the interface for a client to create the token and assign different roles to it.
